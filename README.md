# CMJO_diagnostic


This repo is actively under development, but is meant to take the place of the NCL mjo clivar scripts (https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/mjoclivar.shtml). It will get better, I promise. 


The basic idea is after you have concatenated your daily files (right now I am focus on the output of CESM and observations), you can build all of the MJO diagnostics and plot them nicely.
